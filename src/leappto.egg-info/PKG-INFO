Description: LeApp: Macrocontainers for Legacy Applications
        ==============================================
        
        LeApp is a "Minimum Viable Migration" utility that aims to
        decouple virtualized applications from the operating system
        kernel included in their VM image by migrating them into
        macrocontainers that include all of the traditional components
        of a stateful VM (operating system user space, application
        runtime, management tools, configuration files, etc), but
        use the kernel of the container host rather than providing
        their own.
        
        This approach to migration does *not* immediately take
        advantage of all of the potential usability and
        maintainability benefits offered by modern autoscaling
        platforms, but may be sufficient to allow legacy
        applications to be migrated and legacy hosting services
        to be discontinued.
